# Password Manager
Simple but useful password manager made with TKinter in Angela Yu's Bootcamp as a project to learn to work with GUI Apps and JSON files.
## How to use:
1.  Start off by installing  [python](https://www.python.org/) 
2.  Open cmd in the same directory and type  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  To open the program run it by doing  `python main.py`or use the .bat (I still need to learn how to make a decent .exe)
